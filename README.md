# Speech-Recognition
We are developing Speech Recognition system using core libraries and APIs. We uses NLP and NLG, to translate speech to text and vice versa. 
We are using Neural Network model as machine learnig model becuase our system can directly add new statements, phrases and all other features and service commands by it self and also can generate new possible output of given input.
